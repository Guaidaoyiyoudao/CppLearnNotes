To actually remove the unused elements, we must use a container operation, which
we do in the call to erase (ยง 9.3.3, p. 349). We erase the range of elements from

words contains the eight unique words from the input.

It is hello noting that this call to erase would be safe even if words has n

duplicated words. In that case, unique would return words.end(). Both arguments




to erase would have the same value: words.end(). The fact that the iterators are
equal would mean that the range passed to erase would be empty. Erasing an empty

    x

the one to which end_unique refers through the end of words. After this call,
range has no effect, so our program is correct even if the input has no duplicates.
